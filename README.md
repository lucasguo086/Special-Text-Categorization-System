# Special-Text-Categorization-System
* This project implement a popular machine learning scheme which is "Navie Bayes" to predic the domain - one of Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryota or Virus - from the abstract of research papers about proteins taken from the MEDLINE database. The implementation is writen by python without any machine learning package such as sklearn. 
* Created a system predicts the categorization of given text that describes the different type of proteins taken from the MEDLINE database by implementing an improved version of the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm (Transform the frequencies based on document length) using Python.
* Achieved the accuracy of this categorization system is 96% by removing stop words, giving the different weight of each word.
